# RevenueRescue: AI-Powered Prediction for Optimized Tax Compliance

## Project Overview
This project aims to leverage machine learning to identify taxpayers at high risk of tax evasion. By analyzing historical tax data and patterns, we hope to aid the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) in improving tax compliance.

## Project Goals
1. Collect and preprocess tax data.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
3. Build and evaluate machine learning models.
4. Deploy a Streamlit app to enable interactive use of the model.

## Repository Structure
- `datasets/`: Stores datasets (raw and processed).
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and modeling.
- `src/`: Source code for data processing and modeling.
- `streamlit_app/`: Code for the Streamlit web app.
- `reports/`: Project documentation and analysis reports.
- `results/`: Stores model outputs and visualizations.
